# Bayesian-Machine-Learning
Bayesian Machine Learning Project

This repository conatins the code for the project Bayesian Machine Learning from the MVA master. Basically, the notebook contains the reproduction of several experiments taken from the article $\textit{On the Equivalence between Herding and Conditional Gradient Algorithms}$ written by Francis Bach, Simon Lacoste-Julien and Guillaume Obozinski. The article discusses the similarities between two classes of algorithms and makes a benchmark on several tasks of mean estimation during the experiment part.
